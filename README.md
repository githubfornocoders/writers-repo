**Need a free, robust platform for collecting and collaborating on your writing ideas, for everything from tweets to blog posts? Check out [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) along with [Issue Templates and Forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates).**

## Templates

Use these templates to help structure your thoughts for specific writing needs:

- **Tweet**: includes a 280-character comment so you can visually see about how long it should be.
- **Blog**: set up as an input form with high-level prompts to structure your thoughts.
- **Pitch**: a form based on the Basecamp approach to articulating product ideas.

Thatâ€™s just to get started! Itâ€™s easy to add new ones by [creating templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms) based on those examples.

## Features

Hereâ€™s what you get out of the box:

- Version history for tracking changes
- Commenting for feedback and collaboration
- Labeling for organizing themes and genres
- Project management for workflow tracking with [Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards)
- [Mobile app](https://github.com/mobile/) for capturing formatted content, including images
- Mobile sharing for soliciting feedback

## Getting started

Hereâ€™s all you need to do to start writing with GitHub Issues:

1. Copy this repository using the `Use this template` button.
1. Go to the Issues tab and press the `New issue` button.
1. Select one of the templates or start with a blank issue.

> A note about labels: To use the labels included in the issues templates and forms, you have to create those labels in your repo. They are not copied over when using this repo as a template.

You should see this menu when creating a new issue. ðŸ‘‡
